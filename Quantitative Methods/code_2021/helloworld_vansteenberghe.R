###############################################

# What is R?
#  - language and environment mostly used for statistical computing and graphics
#  - based on S, a statistical programming language started at Bell Labs
#  - has a basis in Fortran and Scheme
#  - extensible, capable of plugging in Fortran, C, C+, and others
#  - open source (and free!)
#  - many people contribute an abundance of useful packages     


# Some Downsides?
#  - inefficient for big computation problems 
#  - bad for big data, though getting better 

# Installation
# can be found at:
# <http://cran.r-project.org/>
#  - download the binary for your OS (or install from source, if you wish)
#  - run the installer and follow the instructions

# Try to comment your code in a comprehensive manner

# Getting to R
# <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming/>

#######
# HELP
#######

# Most useful tool in R, help                  
# Starts an interactive html help file
help.start()

# help function for 'mean'
help(mean)

# also help for 'mean'
?mean

# search
# suppose we want to find matrix product methods
help.search("product")

# note that now, we can find the help file
help(read.csv)

# Navigating
############

# see what working directory you are in:
getwd()

# change to another working directory
setwd("/Users/skimeur/Google Drive/empirical_finance")

# display the working directory, where your file can be loaded and saved, once executed
getwd()

# list all objects in your workspace (currently should be empty)
ls()

#Use a library (if not installed, use Tools, install package)
library(Matching)

#############
# Assignment
############

# there are two way of doing assignment, <- and =
# <- was historically the way of assignment, = can also be used and should make no difference for most of our usages
x <- 5
y = 2

######################
# Classes and Casting
######################

# A class refers to the type of an object.
# Casting refers to recasting an object to another type of class
# there are a few major classes:
# integer and numeric:
x <- 1
class(x)
#x <- as.integer(x)
class(as.integer(x))
class(x)

x <- 2.9999
class(x)
as.integer(x)
# if you prefer to round
round(x)
#x <- as.integer(x)

# character:
y <- "test"
class(y)
y <- as.numeric(y)

# there is also matrix, array, list, expression, and many more, which we will encounter later

# Defining a function
#####################

# we manually define a function that returns x to the power of y
power <- function(x,y){
  return(x^y)
}

#apply this function to our vector x
x
power(x,3)

# It is important to not here that you can use a local variable in the function definition, like x and y and it won't affect the actual value of you variable x and y outside of this function
# If you need to go around this, you can use the super-assignment: <<-
powerbis <- function(x,y){
  x <<- 4
  return(x^y)
}

x
powerbis(x,2)
x
#By using this super-assignement <<- we changed the value of x even outside of our function (this is not usually wanted)

typeof(powerbis)
typeof(x)
typeof(z)

#we define another function
sincos <-function(x,y){
  return(sin(x)+cos(y))
}

#####################
# if - else condition
####################

# we first assign a value to a variable (we could use a boolean) 
sinusite = 1

# depending on the value taken by the variable sinusite,
# we assign different value to the variable str
if (sinusite == 2) {
  str = "power(2,3)"
} else {
  str = "sincos(2,3)"
}

######
# eval
######

#Now that we have as an output a string (str), we can evaluate the string as an R expression using parse() and then evaluate it with eval() 
help(parse)
help(eval)

eval(parse(text = str))

# we check by manually executing it
sincos(2,3)

# now we check the oter possible outcome
power(2,3)

# we modify the value of sinusite
sinusite = 2
eval(parse(text=str))
# Although we changed the value of sinusite, it didn't changed our result

# In order to have a dynamic evalution we can use:
evaluons<-function(sinusite){
  ifelse(sinusite==2,
    eval(parse(text="power(2,3)")),
    eval(parse(text="sincos(2,3)")))
}

# Now it is more dynamic
sinusite=1
evaluons(sinusite)

sinusite=2
evaluons(sinusite)

##########
# For loop
##########

#We can go one step further with defining a for loop 
# to apply the function to each element of the vector sinusite
# simple for loop example
nombre = 1e8
for (i in 1:10) {
  nombre = nombre/i
}

print(nombre)

# we show that the above loop is equivalent to 
# dividing by the factorial 1 * 2 * 3 * etc.
nombre2 = 1e8
print(nombre2/factorial(10))

#Now we apply it to our case
sinusite=c(1,2)
for(i in 1:length(sinusite)){
  print(evaluons(sinusite[i]))
}

########
# sapply
########
#We can also simply use the function sapply() to apply our function to each element of our vectore sinusite
sapply(sinusite,evaluons)

# we redefine x as a range of integer from 1 to 20
x <- (1:20)

# we manually define the cube function
cube <- function(x){return(x^3)}

# and apply the cube function to each element of x
sapply(x,cube)
