    "A bond is a fixed income security that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower. A bond can be issued by governmental or corporate institutions to finance their operations. Investors that buy bonds are lending money to the bond issuer, and, in return, they receive a fixed interest (or coupons) for their investment.\n",

    "Because bonds are fixed income instruments, their price is closely related to interest rates. Moreover, bond prices vary inversely with interest rates. This happens because if interest rates move up, investors will prefer buying newly issued bonds that pay more interest, hence drawing down the price of bonds that pay less interest. The contrary example is also true."
