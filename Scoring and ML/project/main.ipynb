    "Two-sided platforms are multi-sided platforms that connect two different but interdependent groups of customers. By connecting these groups, they add value as intermediaries. A number of examples of two-sided platforms exist, such as Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, etc., which, in very simplified terms, connect product consumers and product providers. Online shopping websites such as Amazon, Walmart, Mercado Livre, Rakouten, etc. are also considered two-sided platforms. Essentially, they connect product buyers and sellers through their user-friendly UI/UX. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, we will focus on the example of Amazon. On every two-sided network we can analyse what we call network side effects. These are the consequences of the increment or decrease of providers or clients in the network. If, in the case of Amazon, for example, there are more product offers, the side-effects with regard to the sellers are rather negative, since there is now more competitive behaviour among them. At the same time, however, this side-effect benefits the clients, as the suppliers now compete for the optimum price and the clients can thus obtain the product at the best price. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same effect can be drawn on the clients. Even if there is a larger quantity of clients, there are no negative side-effects on them, as they do not compete with each other (in most of the cases). Among other things, this can also be attributed to the first hypothesis that the providers offer their products at the best price due to the competitive environment and that the clients are thus at an advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, our work refers to what it means that an offer is the best offer and under which factors Amazon decides to refer to this offer as the best among all the other offers and to select and list it as the first on its website. In this way, we want to find out as to how it is possible for sellers to improve their offerings and to be listed first in Amazon's buy box. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we want to deal with the verticalisation of Amazon's business model. While in a previous model Amazon linked the two edges, i.e. the sellers with the consumers, Amazon has been verticalising its model for some time now and offers its own products independently. Thus, in our work we also want to analyse to what extent Amazon could give themselves an unfair advantage by prioritising their own products and thus promoting more of their own products than in comparison to private sellers."

    "As one can conclude from the result table above, the model that best predicted the seller index in the buy box is the Random Forest Regression, followed by the Ridge, OLS, Lasso and Neural Net.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to see, though, the neural network in the last place of the podium, as it has the most complext architecture behind its curtains. The obtained result though, could be improved by changing the structure of the neural net, adding layers, neurons, changing activation functions, decreasing the learning rate and increasing the epochs or even implementing some other techniques such as early stop, dropout, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering, firstly, only the Random Forest Regression Model we can analyse the features importance. Its important to say that the feature importance, in the random forest regression context, is a measure of how each feature decrease the impurity of the split (the feature with highest decrease is selected for internal node). Thus, one can see, from the feature importance plot, that the most important attribute when it comes to ordering Amazon's product buy-box is whether the seller is Amazon or not. Later on we have product price, number of reviews that the seller has and its global rating followed by whether the product condition is new or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other models, the feature importance obtained (here seen as the significance and module of each one of the coefficients in the OLS, Ridge, or Lasso regressions) is quite similar. The biggest differences for the OLS and Ridge models would be it not considering product price and number of seller reviews as significant. For the Lasso, in the other hand, only the number of seller reviews significance substantially differs from the ones obtained in the random forest regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a business point of view, if we consider the results obtained from the random forest regression model, we can see that this attempt of business verticalization from Amazon's part is very harmful for other sellers as the results show that Amazon tends to prioritize its offers in the buy-box. We can also see that offers with better prices also tend to have better positions in the buy-box and the same goes for sellers with higher reputation (i.e. higher amount of reviews and ratings). \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, if we consider a context where this small sample from Amazon's database fully explains the truth of what is behind Amazon's buy-box selection (which is obviosly not the case), for a small seller to succeed in selling its products in the platform, he/she should aim for products not yet sold by Amazon and try to give the best price possible (comparing with its competitors), trying to build and increase its reputation on the platform."
